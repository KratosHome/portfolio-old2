# Rights Distribution

On the platform, users can create their projects, gather teams, and develop products, resources, programs, applications, etc. Developers hold the rights to the projects they create.

### 1. If the project is not part of an existing business

- The project founder owns 70% of the rights to the project, which they can distribute among the team members at their discretion.
- Other team members have the right to the project's profit, as creating projects on the platform is free.
- Mentors receive a portion of the rights depending on the format of cooperation:
  - 10% of the total percentage is shared among all mentors on the project, depending on the amount of help provided, if their work is free.
  - 3% if the mentor is paid by the platform (team).

### Distribution of 30% rights among the team

- 30% of the rights (excluding mentor rights) are distributed among team members, considering the following roles and conditions:

  - **Managers:** may receive up to 5% of these 30% rights, depending on their contribution to project management, team coordination, and solving organizational issues.

  - **Developers:** are entitled to up to 20% of these 30% rights, distributed proportionally to the number of successfully completed tasks.

  A participant who is no longer involved in the project retains rights proportional to the number of tasks they have completed, provided they are completed successfully and properly handed over to other team members.

### 2. If the project is part of an existing business

If the functionality is being developed by the team, the terms can be discussed individually.

## 4. Changes to Participation Rules

We reserve the right to change the participation rules on the platform at any time.
