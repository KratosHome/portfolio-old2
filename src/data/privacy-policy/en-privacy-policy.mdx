## Project Rights Allocation

On my platform, users can create their projects, assemble teams, and develop products, resources, applications, etc. Developers have rights to the projects they create:

- **Project Founder** owns 80% of the project rights, which they can distribute among team members at their discretion.
- **Other Team Members** have the right to profit from the project, as creating projects on the platform is free.
- **Mentor** receives a portion of the rights depending on the cooperation format: 10% of the rights if their work is free, and 3% if paid by the platform.

### Allocation of 30% Rights Among the Team

30% of the rights (after deducting mentor rights) are distributed among team members, considering the following roles and conditions:

1. **Mentor:** receives rights depending on the cooperation format:
   - **10% rights**, if the mentor works for free, i.e., on a volunteer basis.
   - **3% rights**, if the mentor is paid by the platform for the provided services.

1. **Managers:**
   - May receive up to 5% of these 30% rights, depending on their contribution to project management, team coordination, and resolving organizational issues.

2. **Designers:**
   - May receive up to 5% of these 30% rights, considering completed design tasks, such as creating layouts, UI/UX designs, and other visual elements.

3. **Developers:**
   - Are entitled to receive up to 20% of these 30% rights, which are distributed proportionally to the number of successfully completed tasks. Each developer's contribution is evaluated based on the percentage of completed tasks, considering their complexity and workload.

4. **Partial Task Completion Conditions:**
   - Participants receive a proportional percentage of the task according to the amount of work completed. In case of task transfer to another participant, task completion must be properly documented.

5. **Exclusion of Participants:**
   - A participant who no longer participates in the project retains rights to completed tasks if they are successfully completed and properly transferred to other team members.

### 7. Dismissal of Participants

When dismissing participants from the project, the following provisions regarding the rights to completed tasks and profit distribution should be considered:

1. **Retention of Rights to Completed Tasks:**
   - A participant who leaves the project retains rights to completed tasks. These rights remain valid if the tasks were successfully completed and documented in the project management system.

2. **Proportional Profit Allocation:**
   - Project profit is allocated proportionally to the percentage of completed tasks. This means participants will receive a portion of the profit corresponding to their contribution, determined by the number and complexity of completed tasks.

3. **Task Transfer Upon Dismissal:**
   - If a participant leaves the project with incomplete or partially completed tasks, these tasks must be transferred to another team member with proper documentation and with project management approval.

4. **Forfeiture of Rights:**
   - A participant may be deprived of the right to profit from the project in case of a breach of the contract or if their contribution to the project does not meet the requirements set by the team or platform.

These rules are aimed at fair profit distribution and ensuring continuous project development, even with team composition changes.

### 8. Changes in Participation Rules

I reserve the right to change the participation rules on the platform at any time. All changes will be notified to your email address provided during registration. Continuing work on the project after receiving notice of changes is considered your acceptance of the new terms.

- **Notification of Changes**: In case of changes in participation rules, users will be informed via email.
- **Acceptance of Changes**: Continuing to use the platform or working on projects after notification of changes implies your acceptance of the new terms. If you do not agree with the new rules, you have the right to cease participation in the project and on the platform.
